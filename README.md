I am looking to see if there is a correlation between air quality nationally and adults with diagnosed Asthma.


For the variable `AvgPM2.5`, I had to do some data manipulation by finding the average PM2.5 for each state per year using the county per state per year data given.

I will be doing a time series analysis on the `AvgPM2.5` and `Asthma` variables for the years 2011 to 2016. In conjuction with the time series analysis, I may also look at multi-level modeling as well.
