I am looking to see if there is a correlation between air quality nationally and adults with diagnosed Asthma.


For the variable `AvgPM2.5`, I had to do some data manipulation by finding the average PM2.5 for each state per year using the county per state per year data given.

I will be doing a time series analysis on the `AvgPM2.5` and `Asthma` variables for the years 2011 to 2016. In conjuction with the time series analysis, I may also look at multi-level modeling as well.

### Abstract
Air quality and asthma, among other respiratory illnesses, are a continued struggle for many communities. In addition, the continued growth of the national and global population warrants our nation's pollution to continue to increase. This, in turn, will give to a worsening in respiratory conditions and an increase of respiratory troubles, such as asthma. Using data provided by the CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network Query Tool, statistical analysis was used to see if there is a relationship between the average number of days above PM2.5 standard levels nationally and the percent of adults diagnosed with asthma who report they currently have asthma nationally through the period of 2011 to 2016. The variables were looked at both individually and against each other with the period established using the statistical tool R. Basic statistical analysis and time series modeling were used as a way of testing for a relationship between air quality and asthma.
